# Energy-Poverty-Project
Our ENERES 131 final project will use different energy poverty indicators to understand the distribution and prevalence of energy vulnerabilities across California. Energy poverty is caused by a combination of low incomes, inadequate energy efficiency of housing units and appliances, and high energy prices. We will hence use metrics that capture the different dimensions (economical, behavioural and physical) of energy poverty. By doing this, we hope to be able to show a more nuanced picture of the experiences of energy deprivation in the US, helping shift the focus of energy poverty alleviation efforts from focusing uniquely or mostly on affordability issues and metrics, to include long term targeted investments in energy efficiency retrofits informed by indicators of a household’s inability to keep home adequately warm or cool.

Our motivations for this project were twofold: on one hand, we sought to provide the grounds for local stakeholders and advocacy groups to possibly use our findings and visualizations to be able to make claims on how different indicators used to measure the prevalence of energy poverty can shape the recognition and alleviation efforts regarding the issue; and on the other hand, to bridge a gap between the quantification of energy use in the residential energy sector at high geographic resolution across then entire state of California. We were able to develop models to predict enery consumption at a high spatial resolution, utilizing publicly available data from the Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS), the American Community Survey (ACS), Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), and the DOE’s Low-Income Energy Affordability (LEAD) data. Our results produce a tool to help policymakers to undeerstand local experiences of energy poverty and integrate when in their design of weatherisations and bill assistance programs.
